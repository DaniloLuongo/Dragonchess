Notes

1.If you want to play on the same pc, open the jar file two times: on the first one click Host Game as usual, on the second one click directly Connect, without specifing the IP
  address.

Known issues

1.You can't click Connect while the server hasn't started yet, so you need to wait for the server to start hosting
